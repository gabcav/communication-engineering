The development is still going on and will be for coming years, both in terms  of technology itself and its utilisation. It is therefore clear that there will be demand for knowledge on  telecommunications in years to come. In this course, basic understanding of telecommunications will be provided  emphasising the system view. The course begins by a short review of the history of telecommunications. Following is a discussion of major signal treatment methodologies before and after transmission over a communications  channel, both for analogue and digital transmission. An introduction to telecommunications media will be given, wireless  and wired telecommunications, amplitude and angle modulation, multiplexing and multiple access, random processes and  noise in telecommunication systems. How to design a telecommunication system with respect to signal-noise ratio,  digital modulation techniques, eye diagrams and Shannon\u2019s law on channel capacity. Finally, data encoding and decoding  will be introduced, how to detect and even correct errors. The teaching will be in the form of lectures and discussions.  Problems will be solved in class and home assignments given.</p>","tags":["About"]},{"location":"#learning-outcomes","title":"Learning Outcomes","text":"<p>At the end of this course, a student shall be able to:</p> <ul> <li>design and calculate the properties of systems using amplitude or angle modulation</li> <li>describe and implement digital modulation methods and receiving concepts</li> <li>explain and calculate the performance of systems in the presence of noise</li> <li>describe and explain the limitations faced when designing telecommunication systems</li> <li>explain and implement communications among multiple users</li> <li>help solving telecommunication problems in the industry</li> <li>conduct further studies in telecommunications</li> </ul>","tags":["About"]},{"location":"#weekly-schedule","title":"Weekly Schedule","text":"<p>This is the schedule for the course RAF501G</p> Week Date Time Slot (GMT) Topic 1(18\u201322 August 2025) Monday, 18 August 10:00 \u2013 12:20        Introduction to the subject, an informal overview of the history of communications, and a discussion of the course.
