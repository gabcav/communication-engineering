# Welcome to Communication Engineering

Telecommunication systems are everywhere in modern societies, and great progress has been made in the field of 
telecommunications in recent years. The development is still going on and will be for coming years, both in terms 
of technology itself and its utilisation. It is therefore clear that there will be demand for knowledge on 
telecommunications in years to come. In this course, basic understanding of telecommunications will be provided 
emphasising the system view. The course begins by a short review of the history of telecommunications.  
Following is a discussion of major signal treatment methodologies before and after transmission over a communications 
channel, both for analogue and digital transmission. An introduction to telecommunications media will be given, wireless 
and wired telecommunications, amplitude and angle modulation, multiplexing and multiple access, random processes and 
noise in telecommunication systems. How to design a telecommunication system with respect to signal-noise ratio, 
digital modulation techniques, eye diagrams and Shannonâ€™s law on channel capacity. Finally, data encoding and decoding 
will be introduced, how to detect and even correct errors. The teaching will be in the form of lectures and discussions. 
Problems will be solved in class and home assignments given.

## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, a student shall be able to:

- design and calculate the properties of systems using amplitude or angle modulation
- describe and implement digital modulation methods and receiving concepts
- explain and calculate the performance of systems in the presence of noise
- describe and explain the limitations faced when designing telecommunication systems
- explain and implement communications among multiple users
- help solving telecommunication problems in the industry
- conduct further studies in telecommunications
