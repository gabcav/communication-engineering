# Welcome to RAF501G Communication Engineering

Telecommunication systems are everywhere in modern societies, and great progress has been made in the field of 
telecommunications in recent years. The development is still going on and will be for coming years, both in terms 
of technology itself and its utilisation. It is therefore clear that there will be demand for knowledge on 
telecommunications in years to come. In this course, basic understanding of telecommunications will be provided 
emphasising the system view. The course begins by a short review of the history of telecommunications.  
Following is a discussion of major signal treatment methodologies before and after transmission over a communications 
channel, both for analogue and digital transmission. An introduction to telecommunications media will be given, wireless 
and wired telecommunications, amplitude and angle modulation, multiplexing and multiple access, random processes and 
noise in telecommunication systems. How to design a telecommunication system with respect to signal-noise ratio, 
digital modulation techniques, eye diagrams and Shannonâ€™s law on channel capacity. Finally, data encoding and decoding 
will be introduced, how to detect and even correct errors. The teaching will be in the form of lectures and discussions. 
Problems will be solved in class and home assignments given.

## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, a student shall be able to:

- design and calculate the properties of systems using amplitude or angle modulation
- describe and implement digital modulation methods and receiving concepts
- explain and calculate the performance of systems in the presence of noise
- describe and explain the limitations faced when designing telecommunication systems
- explain and implement communications among multiple users
- help solving telecommunication problems in the industry
- conduct further studies in telecommunications

## Background and Motivations


### Communications systems design

Merges concepts from signals and systems, probability and random processes, and statistical inference.


The student should leave with an understanding of


  * Baseband and passband signals and channels 
  * modulation formats appropriate for these channels
  * random processes and noise
  * a systematic framework for optimum demodulation based on signal spaceconcepts
  * performance analysis
  * power -bandwidth tradeoffs for common modulation schemes,
  * a hint of the power of information theory and channel coding,
  * introduction to communicationtechniques for dispersive channels and multiple antenna systems. 
  * Given the significant ongoing research and development activity in wireless communication, and the fact that an understanding of wireless link design provides a sound background for approaching other communication links, material enabling hands-on discovery of key concepts for wireless system design is interspersed


## Introduction to the course

In Section 1.1, we provide a high-level description of analog and digital communication
systems, and discuss why digital communication is the inevitable design choice in
modern systems. In Section 1.2, we briefly provide a technological perspective on recent developments
in communication. We do not attempt to provide a comprehensive discussion of the
fascinating history of communication: thanks to the advances in communication that brought us
the Internet, it is easy to look it up online! A discussion of the scope of this textbook is provided
in Section 1.3.

### Progress in telecommunications 

Over the past two decades has been nothing short of revolutionary, with communications taken for granted in modern society to the same extent as electricity.


This lecture provides a perspective on communication systems, including a discussion of the
transition from analog to digital communication and how it colors the selection of material in
this text.

### What is a Communication? 


Process of information transfer between points in space, as well as
communication between points in time (i.e, storage).


### Communications across space 


Radio waves carry our phone conversation between our cell phone and the nearest base station, and
coaxial cables (or optical fiber, or radio waves from a satellite) deliver television from a remote
location to our home. 


### Communications across time 

Use of storage media such as compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), hard drives and memory sticks.


### Key steps in the operation of a communication link

  * **Insertion of information into a signal**, termed the transmitted signal, compatible with the physical medium of interest.

  * **Propagation of the signal** through the physical medium (termed the channel) in space or time;

  * **Extraction of information from the signal** (termed the received signal) obtained after propagation through the medium.


### Digital vs. Analog systems 


Digital systemes are fast replacing analog
systems in both time and space communications domains
